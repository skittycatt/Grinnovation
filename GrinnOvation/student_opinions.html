    <strong>The following paragraphs are the context provided to the students before the survey questions were asked.</strong>
    <p>We are developing a website for our software development course. Our assigned goal for this project is to display
        innovation at Grinnell. We have provided below the definition of innovation at Grinnell which we have been
        given.</p>
    <p>All data collected from this survey will be fully anonymized. Student name and student organization affiliation
        will not be published.</p>
    <p>Conner Stanfield with the Admissions Office noted 4 major points of innovation at Grinnell: Diversity,
        cross-departmental collaboration, professor research, and student centered programming.</p>

    <p>All students have been granted anonymity for their responses. Response order is randomized - answer 1 for the
        first question may not be the same respondent as answer 1 for question 2.</p>

        <h3 id="diversity">How has diversity at Grinnell College affected your education and/or future -- positively,
            negatively, or otherwise?</h3>
        <p>"I feel like the "diversity" that Grinnell boasts about is a lie. Classrooms are filled with white people and
            other discriminatory people. They treat other cultures like things they can use and it has such a negative
            impact on my mental health and learning here. I didn't think I would need to convince my classmates that I
            am a human in college."</p>
        <p>"Diversity has exposed to me a lot of new perspectives and experiences that I would not have encountered
            otherwise. As a low-income student, it has also exposed me to some more negative aspects, because some
            Grinnellians fail to see their own privileged economic background. Overall, diversity has had a positive
            effect though."</p>
        <p>"(Lack of) diversity has been negative in some classes in that I am one of the few POC in class, which
            doesn't encourage me to share since I don't feel as comfortable. But in some classes I have learned from
            other POC students, those who are from America and those who are international students,"</p>

        <h3 id="crossdept">How has cross-departmental collaboration at Grinnell College affected your education and/or
            future -- positively, negatively, or otherwise?</h3>
        <p>"Positively"</p>
        <p>"Cross-departmental collaboration has affected me positively. Most of the classes that have been
            cross-departmental have been super interesting and I have learned from these different fields. "</p>
        <p>"It has been very positive, and I have encountered most disciplines in my time at Grinnell. I feel as though
            I got a very thorough education, and I like that the departments work together."</p>

    <div>
        <h3 id="mapmip">How has professor research (MAP/MIP) at Grinnell College affected your education and/or future
            -- positively, negatively, or otherwise?</h3>
        <p>"I am doing a MAP, but one that I have designed with the assistant of a professor, and this experience has
            been very positive. I have really enjoyed the opportunity. "</p>
        <p>"Positively"</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3 id="student-programming">How has student-centered programming/events at Grinnell College affected your
            education and/or future -- positively, negatively, or otherwise? (E.g. headshot photobooth, GORP,
            Gardner/Harris, Freesound, etc.)</h3>
        <p>"Positively! Love the CLS and Harris/Gardners have always been fun."</p>
        <p>"These kinds of events have been positive for me. I enjoy having activities to do with friends, and some
            events like the headshot photo booth actively benefit my career. It is also nice to know that, even though
            we are in the middle of Iowa, there is still a lot to do."</p>
        <p>"These programs are nice, but are hard to organize and make happen from the leaders side. "</p>
