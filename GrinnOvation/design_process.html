        <div class="column midline">
            <p class="designcol">Our design brief was: You will build an interatictive app to show our innovation and connect with potential donors. Our initial interpretation of this prompt was to aim to
                convince potential donor alumni to donate to student organizations. Our initial plan to fulfill this
                goal was to collect information about the multitude of student organizations at Grinnell. We generated a
                variety of ideas for data we could collect that would fit different forms of visualization. One of these
                types of data would have been qualitative data about the activities of student organizations. Another
                type would have been statistics on budget, attendance, cost, community engagement, etc. A major issue
                with relying on collecting data from student organizations was the potentially low response rate, and
                the fact that even a student in a leadership position might not have robust records of previous years of
                organization activity, especially if those statistics weren't collected in the first place.</p>
            <p class="designcol">After meeting with our alumni mentor, Conner Stanfield, we refined our definition of what we would
                consider innovative at Grinnell. Conner identified four (three) ways in which (he believed? Grinnell
                believed?) Grinnell is unique: diversity, professor and undergraduate student research opportunities,
                alumni profiles, and student-centered programming. For each of these categories we would display
                relevant data using either a data visualization or text.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p class="designcol">Our project morphed and took on many different design forms throughout the initial stages of our project. 
                Initially, when we were under the original assumption that the goal of our project was to convince alumni 
                donors to donate to Student Organizations at the college, we envisioned the app to contain multiple data 
                visualizations on various data from Student Organizations across the college, with these visualizations 
                appearing on a large “Student Organizations” tab that was navegable via an extensive sidebar. Other tabs 
                would have included a “Wilson Center” tab explaining the purpose of the Wilson Center at Grinnell along 
                with corresponding data visualizations, and tabs on a few of the major on-campus events that speak to the 
                innovation at Grinnell, a “Pioneer Weekend” tab and a “Hack GC” tab. Both of these tabs would be in a 
                similar format to the others in that it would explain the corresponding event/resource, provide helpful 
                links and visualizations that help to convey the extent of innovation that it promotes at Grinnell.</p>

    <h2 class="designhead">Structuring the Website</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column midline">
            <p class="designcol">One of the challenges of designing a website for this data was making sure a user could navigate it 
                easily. Ideally, a user would be able to quickly identify the series of steps needed in order to find the 
                information they were interested in. In order to make the structure of the website predictable, we planned 
                to separate each topic into subcategories. Professor research could be divided by department, student 
                organization data could be divided by area of involvement, etc. These subcategories could be navigated by 
                a sidebar with anchor links. Since this is a very common way of organizing a website, we believed it would 
                be familiar enough that users could easily navigate the site, as well as providing enough of a guide to 
                other categories of data that a user could explore unfamiliar topics. We decided to have all of the 
                sections on one page so a user could use ctrl + F to search without our implementing a search function. 
                An image carousel on the home page would serve to direct users to various pages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p class="designcol">After identifying the issues with collecting data from Student Organizations and our conversation with 
                Conner Stanfield we redesigned the structure of our app to align with the overall shift in mission of our 
                app. Since our goal was no longer to convince alumni to donate to Student Orgs (for which we were 
                displaying next to no data), we adopted an informative app layout, in lieu of a persuasive one. The tabs 
                became “Diversity”, “Professor and Undergraduate Student Research Opportunities”, “Alumni Profiles”, and 
                “Student-Centered Programming” and within each tab we sought to provide simple text that was both 
                informative and which conveyed the truth about Grinnell, with no need for flashy effects and 
                visualizations. This manifested in a simple card layout for the “Alumni Profiles” tab which simply briefly 
                described some of Grinnell's notable alumni. We kept the idea of an image carousel on the homepage which 
                served to direct users to different tabs within the app.</p>

    <h2 class="designhead">Reconsidering Student Data</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column midline">
            <p class="designcol">Given the quantity of students at Grinnell, we decided that it would not be feasible to elicit similarly 
                structured data from all student organizations. Therefore, we narrowed our focus for student opinion to ask
                about each of the areas identified by Conner as unique strengths at Grinnell. In order to determine what 
                questions we would ask students, we spoke with Susan Sanning, Director of Social Innovation at Grinnell. 
                From the conversation with Susan, we decided to shift our project's tone from encouraging donations to 
                accurately reflecting student opinion. We put out a survey which identified the four areas of interest to 
                our topic and asked how each area had affected the student, either positively or negatively.</p>
            <p class="designcol">As a result of the new format for our textual data, we adjusted the structure of the student opinion page 
                to now show the four questions as subsections, with anonymized individual student responses below each 
                question.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p class="designcol">Further development saw the change of the “Student-Centered Programming” tab to “Student Opinions” in an 
                attempt to use the few honest responses that we obtained from our survey on Student Organizations at the 
                college, and the “Professor and Undergraduate Student Research Opportunities” was simplified to a 
                “Mentored Advanced Projects (MAPS)” page as this is the most Grinnell-specific aspect of research that both
                highlights innovation at Grinnell and innovation specific to Grinnell. The former tab became the responses 
                of the Student Organizations to our survey questions, arranged by question and joined by anchor links (so 
                the user could navigate to the question that most interests them at the top of the page to view the student
                organizations' responses) and the latter tab became a large interactive visualization that allows the user
                to filter and view where students who participate in MAPs at Grinnell end up post-Grinnell. The aim of this
                latter visualization is both informative and for alumni donors to see the amazing potential and effect a 
                MAP has on a student's career, and donate for more MAP funding accordingly.</p>

    <h2 class="designhead">Reconsidering Research Data</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column midline">
            <p class="designcol">In order to address the unique research environment at Grinnell, we collected data from the Registrar 
                about rates of student participation in Mentored Advanced Project (MAP)/Mentored Introductory Project (MIP).
                We also collected data about the post-graduation outcomes of MAP/MIP students in order to answer how MAP/MIP
                participation might impact different majors.Our goal was to depict the flow of MAP/MIP students into their 
                respective fields. As such, we decided to use a Sankey diagram to illustrate the pathways taken by students
                in different majors.</p>
            <p class="designcol">A major issue with our chosen visualization was that the quantity of majors resulted in an overwhelming, 
                confusing diagram. The solution the design team generated while discussing data visualization with Vivero 
                fellows solved this by allowing the user to select/filter by major</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p class="designcol">Finally, the image carousel changed to simply provide visual diversity of the different ways that 
                innovation appears at Grinnell. We decided not to do links because we did not have sufficient time to 
                provide relevant information for each of the many ways in which innovation appears at Grinnell, but we 
                wanted to at least showcase, visually, the many outlets of innovation that Grinnell College offers.</p>

    <h2 class="designhead">Accessibility</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column midline">
            <p class="designcol">Using advise obtained from the article US Accessibility Guidance for teams in this section we explain how 
          we made our app accessible. In terms of our Frontend development, we made our app accessible, by providing 
          accurate and descriptive headings. For example, on our design page we clearly state the headings of each 
          section. To mention a couple examples, we have Structuring the Website and Reconsidering Research Data. 
          We also added page structures by having a navigation bar. In terms of Visual design, we made sure we had 
          good color contrast by using only black and white on our pages for texts. In terms of UX design we added 
          navigation shortcuts on our Student Opinions tab where on the top of the page we have links that take you 
          to Student Opinion on Diversity, MAPS and MIPS etc. We didn’t have enough time to fully work on keyboard 
          accessibility. We were planning on having our application be keyboard-only accessible and to be screen-reader 
          compatible but due to time constraints we couldn’t fully implement that.

    <h2 class="designhead">Performance Assessment</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In order to assess our implementation, the design team reviewed the developers’ code and used the Reactlog 
          tool to view the reactivity network over the course of a variety of test cases. The Developers used reactivity variables 
          when building the MAPS graph so the designers used reactlog to test the MAPS graph. Below is a video of our reactlog
          when a user initially opens the MAPS tab and then selects the following subjects CSC, Bio, Chem and Math:
