            <p class="designcol">Our design brief was (quote the design brief). Our initial interpretation of this prompt was to aim to
                convince potential donor alumni to donate to student organizations. Our initial plan to fulfill this
                goal was to collect information about the multitude of student organizations at Grinnell. We generated a
                variety of ideas for data we could collect that would fit different forms of visualization. One of these
                types of data would have been qualitative data about the activities of student organizations. Another
                type would have been statistics on budget, attendance, cost, community engagement, etc. A major issue
                with relying on collecting data from student organizations was the potentially low response rate, and
                the fact that even a student in a leadership position might not have robust records of previous years of
                organization activity, especially if those statistics weren't collected in the first place.</p>

            <p class="designcol">After meeting with our alumni mentor, Conner Stanfield, we refined our definition of what we would
                consider innovative at Grinnell. Conner identified four (three) ways in which (he believed? Grinnell
                believed?) Grinnell is unique: diversity, professor and undergraduate student research opportunities,
                alumni profiles, and student-centered programming. For each of these categories we would display
                relevant data using either a data visualization or text.</p>
