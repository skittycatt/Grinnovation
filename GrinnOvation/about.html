        <p>The purpose of GrinnOvation is to show Innovation at Grinnell mainly directed towards our Alumni audience.
            Here we link innovation to the different activities Grinnell college students do whilst in college
            like(Maps, and Student Orgs) and after graduating. GrinnOvation puts an effort into displaying student
            opinion so that our users can get an idea of how it feels like to be a student here. As GrinnOvation our
            goal is not to persuade Alumni to donate rather we're trying to show the Alumni, a problem or concern student
            have and provide the Alumni with information on how they can get that donated.</p>

        <p>There were many ideas and groups that we wish we could have included in this project.
            Unfortunately due to time constraints, we were not able to include the following
            groups; which we believe also contribute to innovation at Grinnell:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Disability Cultural Center</li>
            <li>More student perspective</li>
            <li>Wilson Center</li>
            <li>Department SEPCs</li>
            <li>Professor research</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These groups (and many more) would be wonderful additions to the project if it
            were to be continued in the future.</p>
